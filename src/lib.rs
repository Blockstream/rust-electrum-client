#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! This library provides an extendable Bitcoin-Electrum client that supports batch calls,
//! notifications and multiple transport methods.
//!
//! By default this library is compiled with support for SSL servers using [`rustls`](https://docs.rs/rustls) and support for
//! plaintext connections over a socks proxy, useful for Onion servers. Using different features,
//! the SSL implementation can be removed or replaced with [`openssl`](https://docs.rs/openssl).
//!
//! A `minimal` configuration is also provided, which only includes the plaintext TCP client.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use electrum_client::Client;
//!
//! let mut client = Client::new("kirsche.emzy.de:50001")?;
//! let response = client.server_features()?;
//! # Ok::<(), electrum_client::Error>(())
//! ```
